excerpt: 'The throughput rate of mass spectrometers and the size of publicly available
metabolomics data are growing rapidly. Illuminating the molecules present in untargeted mass
spectrometry data that cannot be identified by existing approaches (the dark matter of
metabolomics) remains a challenging task. In the past decade, molecular networking and MASST
were introduced to organize and query untargeted mass spectrometry data. While useful for single
datasets, these methods cannot scale to searching and clustering billions of mass spectral data in
metabolomics repositories, e.g. the Global Natural Product Social (GNPS) molecular networking
infrastructure. To address this shortcoming, we developed an efficient strategy for the computation
of dot-product between mass spectra, where the relevant information from spectral datasets is stored
in an indexing table. Based on this strategy, we designed MASST+ and Networking+, scalable
approaches for querying and clustering mass spectra that can process datasets that are up to three
orders of magnitude larger than the state-of-the-art. For example, MASST+ can query against 717
million spectra from the GNPS public data in less than an hour and Networking+ is able to map the
chemical diversity of all GNPS public data in days.'
