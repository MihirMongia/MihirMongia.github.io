Thanks for gracing this webpage with your presence. I'm starting my postdoc with Mike Snyder in the fall of 2023 and am finishing my PhD in Computer Science with Hosein Mohimani. 

My most important research contributions
======
I have developed algorithms two to three orders of magnitude faster for clustering and searching gargantuan databases of mass spectrometry. This work is currently in review at Nature Biotechnology. In my last project I am currently working on an algorithm that can identify peptides from mass spectrometry measurements that is both fast and accurate. No current algorithm can do both simultaneously. I expect at minimum the ideas from these two algorithms to permeate industry.
