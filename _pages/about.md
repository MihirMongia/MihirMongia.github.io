Thanks for gracing this webpage with your presence. I'm starting my postdoc with Mike Snyder in the fall of 2023 and am currently finishing my PhD in Computer Science with Hosein Mohimani. 

My most important research contributions
======
I have developed algorithms two to three orders of magnitude faster for clustering and searching gargantuan databases of mass spectrometry. This work is currently in review at Nature Biotechnology. In my last project I am currently working on an algorithm that can identify peptides from mass spectrometry measurements that is both fast and accurate. No current algorithm can do both simultaneously. I expect at minimum the ideas from these two algorithms to permeate industry.

Past work experience
======
For one year after undergrad, I worked about as an analog designer and webpage developer at two startups. After my masters, I decided to work at a non-profit in New York attempting to use data science for social good. This past summer I worked in a hedge fund predicting the returns of high risk personal loans. Here I was able to build a machine learning model that matched industrial competitors.

Entrepreneurship and Consulting
======
I am very interested in pursuing entrepreneurship ventures and consulting opportunities. I am open to all types of problems that require quantitative and machine learning thinking. Would be especially interested in quantative finance. Please do get in touch!
