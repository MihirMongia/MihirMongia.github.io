Thanks for gracing this webpage with your presence. I care about using quantitative methods to solve meaningful problems. To this end, I've been working on problems related to biology and health. I'm starting my postdoc at Stanford with Mike Snyder in the fall of 2023 and am currently finishing my PhD in Computer Science with Hosein Mohimani at CMU. Previously, I spent one summer thinking and learning about deep learning in the lab of Yoshua Bengio.

My most important research contributions
======
There are 3 main computational routines used in the field of metabolomics. For each of these tools, I have developed a new version that is 2-3 orders of magnitude faster. These results will be released in Nature Biotechnology. I expect at minimum the ideas from this algorithm to permeate industry. 


Past work experience
======
For one year after undergrad, I worked about as an analog designer and webpage developer at two startups. After my masters, I decided to work at a non-profit in New York attempting to use data science for social good. This past summer I worked in a hedge fund predicting the returns of high risk personal loans. Here I was able to build a machine learning model that matched industrial competitors.

Entrepreneurship and Consulting
======
I am interested in pursuing entrepreneurship ventures and consulting opportunities. I am open to all types of problems ranginging from healtchare and precision medicine to quantitative finance. Please do get in touch!
